       <h1>HTML Questions</h1>
       <h2>Mason Rich</h2>
       <h3>What are &lt;meta&gt; elements in html? Where are they used? Provide two examples</h3>
       <p>The meta elements can be found towards the beginning of the file and are used to describe the page and also give any keywords. An example would be how we specify the set keyboard that will be used by saying &lt;meta charset&equals;&quot;UTF&mdash;8&quot;&sol;&gt; Another example would be when we describe who the author is. If I were the author, I would say &lt;meta name&equals;&quot;author&quot; content&equals;&quot;Mason Rich&quot; &sol;&gt;
       </p>
       <h3>Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;. Provide an example for each.</h3>
       <p>The header is used as a container for important information regarding the website. Like we think of when we hear &quot;header&quot;, it appears at the top of the page. It can also be a photo. Article is used in order to appropriately separate content within the website, just as would read in a newspaper article. Sections are to designate different parts within the website. Footer is what will appear at the bottom of the webpage and usually includes information like email addresses addresses, contact information, etc.

       <h3>Explain the impact, if any, of casing (upper vs. lower) and white space inside your HTML code. How about the impact of casing and spacing within your file naming conventions?</h3>
       <p>It is necessary when we name our files, that we do so with the correct casing. If our files do not match letter for letter by their casing, then we will have an error or will open up the wrong file. HTML does not care if we upper or lovercase within our code though. For example, &lt;h3&gt; and &lt;H3&gt; produce the same result.Yet, it is always good to practice being consistent. White space is not read on the web browser through HTML. So any spaces within our code are reduced down to one single space between words         even if there are 7 spaces. A nonbreaking space or a preformatted text can be used and it will include the spaces. </p>
       <h3>What is the difference between <strong>http</strong>&colon;&sol;&sol; used to retrieve a webpage in a browser, and <strong>ftp</strong>&colon;&sol;&sol; used to upload pages to the server?</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and its purpose is to transfer files from one computer to another computer.</li>
           <li>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol which helps the world wide web access the HTML/webpage</li>
           <li>HTTP helps us see the websites</li>
           <li>FTP is used to access and also transfer files.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Definitions (in my own words)</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>HTML &mdash; Stands for HyperText Markup Language and gives the basic layout and structure of a website. </li>
           <li>CSS &mdash; Stands for Cascade Style Sheets. It gives style to the webpage and is interlinked with HTML to provide design.</li>
           <li>JavaScript &mdash; Is a programming lanuage that brings life and actions to the website and helps people to be able to interact with the website.</li>
       </ul>
